Warning! Mixing Conda and module environments may lead to corruption of the
user environment. 
We do not recommend users mixing those two environments unless absolutely
necessary. Note that 
SURF does not provide any support for Conda environment.
For more information, please refer to our software policy page:
https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Software+policy+Snellius#SoftwarepolicySnellius-UseofAnacondaandMinicondaenvironmentsonSnellius 

Remember that many packages have already been installed on the system and can
be loaded using 
the 'module load <package__name>' command. If you are uncertain if a package is
already available 
on the system, please use 'module avail' or 'module spider' to search for it.

2025-11-11 11:28:34.709593: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:210] This TensorFlow binary is optimized to use available CPU instructions in performance-critical operations.
To enable the following instructions: AVX2 AVX512F AVX512_VNNI FMA, in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.
Args: Namespace(seed=42, model_repo='openai/clip-vit-base-patch16', model_name='', d_model=768, revision=None, input_size=512, patch_size=16, data_dir='./datasets/split_angles_mvimagenet', dataset_name='mvimgnet', train_fs_path=None, val_fs_path=None, train_bins='90', val_bins='0', batch_size=64, augmentation_epoch=1, memory_size=None, num_workers=32, n_neighbours=30, nn_method='faiss', nn_params=None, return_knn_details=None)
Loading model from Hugging Face: openai/clip-vit-base-patch16
Using DataParallel with 4 GPUs.
The model does not support automatic embedding interpolation, 
but manual embedding interpolation will be applied if the input_size provided does not match 
the input_size on which the model was trained.
Detected 4 GPUs. Enabling FAISS index sharding.
